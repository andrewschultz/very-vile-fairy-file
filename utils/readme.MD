README.MD for utils subdirectory of very vile fairy file

SCRIPTS:
* main
** dno.py: notes duplicate checker, which may be merged with Ailihphilia's
** vv.py is the main one that helps us locate alliterative rhymes.
** vvsp.py locates crossovers with Tragic Mix/spoonerisms (spopal.otl)
* minor
** sct.py keeps track of scoring incidents and what is/isn't necessary.

DATA:

* 2s.txt is a data file that should not be edited. It contains the frequencies of starts for 2 letter words. We could, of course, read in the whole file each time, but that's that much more overhead.
