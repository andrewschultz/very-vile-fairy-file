A vision! Some tough-looking people sit sneering around an empty book. They are quickly revealed as the Plight Plotter, the Spite Spotter, the Fright Frotteur, and the Right Rotter. They are seeking to formalize the knowledge they have gained from picking on, well, fight fodder. Such as the Trite Trotter and the Night Nodder. You watch them each write parts of a book at ultra-speed before they walk out to by some white water and call out "Bright! Broader!"
The book's cover slowly becomes colored in. It is the Very Vile Fairy File.

The plotters from your previous vision remark how it is not just a guide to manipulation, but something that can affect people from afar. Its one weakness: if someone gets too close and is legitimately happy and forgiving around it, its spell will break.
They leave it by the Real Rot/Feel Fought Spiel Spot, because they have other evil to delegate, elsewhere. Small relief--facing them would've been too much.

The loser of the rock paper scissors game's eyes open wide as they realize the Very Vile Fairy File doesn't just have lame poetry. It has advice on important things like pushing people around and getting in their head! In the end, there's a fight over the book, but nobody manages to tear it apart. There's more fast-forwarding, and once everyone is done re-reading it, they leave it somewhere distant. Maybe for the next person, or their underlings, to read.
You can already feel the Very Vile Fairy File working on you, reminding you of things you'd rather forget. These brief flashes may pop up for the remainder of your adventure.
