Why yes, I'm sort of a silly soul. At least when I'm writing games.

#ttc-table-of-wet-wood-guesses-het-hood
>het hood

You consider the possibility of changing the Wet Wood to a Straight Pride parade, but decide against it, as you're worried you might get trampled by all of a dozen people.

#ttc-table-of-rift-river-guesses-drift-driver
>drift driver

No vehicle comes to take you across the river. And that doesn't quite rhyme, anyway. You just feel you could use another person's help, here.

#ttc-table-of-rift-river-guesses-lift-liver

Learner needle
You gain no nutritious meat nor uplifting advice. But you must be close. You just feel you could use another person's help, here.

#ttc-table-of-rift-river-guesses-shift-shiver

Learner needle
You try fearing things different ways, but nobody comes to comfort you.

#ttc-table-of-rift-river-guesses-sift-siever

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-coo-coats
>coo coats
!Learner needle
No need for warmth.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-do-dotes

!Learner needle
Wowzers! What a neat document Too Totes New Notes is. Golly gee!

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-flu-flew-floats
>flu floats
!Learner needle
No flying craft appears, but on the bright side, you fail to feel sick.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-glue-gloats
>glue gloats
!Learner needle
What kind of person boasts about stockpiling glue?

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-goo-goats
>goo goats
!Learner needle
Ugh! Regular goats are messy enough.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-grew-grue-groats

!Learner needle
No coins spring from the ground. A coin with a grue would be kind of creepy, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-rue-rotes
>rue rotes
!Learner needle
You fail to find yourself in a more straightforward adventure.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-shoo-shoats
>shoo shoats
!Learner needle
There are no young pigs here to shoo.

#ttc-table-of-too-totes-new-notes-guesses-stew-stoats

Badger, Mole and Rat would agree that's going too far. Even Toad.

You do feel sort of paranoid here, but fortunately, nothing is behind you or needs to stop.

#ttc-table-of-vined-vault-guesses-signed-salt

Alas, the walls of the vault do not turn to salt. Perhaps they still have a structural deficiency, though.

Learner needle
You could use a delicious meal, but perhaps there is something even simpler the mean mass can become.

#ttc-table-of-vined-vault-guesses-clean-class
>clean class
Learner needle
You can't help but feel the mean mass could be more wholesome, but that's not quite the right way to do things. It doesn't feel quite natural enough.

#ttc-table-of-vined-vault-guesses-glean-glass
>glean glass

No, there's no hidden window you overlooked.

Learner needle
This isn't that sort of game.

#ttc-table-of-vined-vault-guesses-seen-scene-sass

You worry any sass you direct at the mean mass would be spun back at you. But there must be a way to change the mean mass!

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-cash-cap
>cash cap
Learner needle
You need more than just a homonym here.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-clash-clap
>clash clap
Learner needle
Your vehement applause goes unheeded. But perhaps other violence might be more productive.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-crash-crap
>crash crap
Learner needle
Profanity isn't necessary, here. Even minor ones.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-flash-flap

Perhaps more focused violence would work better.

Learner needle
You don't need to be dressed outlandishly to figure what to do.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-bo-bow-bit

There's no fiddly bit like a bow. You showed a bit of persistence there looking for it, though.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-bro-brit-britt

Learner needle
You don't need a sidekick. Well, right now, you don't. Hard to summon them, anyway.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-co-kit
>co kit
Learner needle
You receive no kit to help you throw, corporate or otherwise.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-crow-crit
>crow crit
Learner needle
You wait for a little bird to give advice, but nothing happens.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-flow-flit
>flow flit
Learner needle
You don't need your mind to wander further. You need to focus on a solution.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-foe-fit
>foe fit
Learner needle
Complaining and speculation about who or what put you there won't help.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-glow-glit
>glow glit
Learner needle
Glowing slimy matter is still slimy. Besides, you need to look inside YOU, here.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-go-get-git
>go get
Learner needle
You have no-one to order around, not that it'd do any good.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-ho-hoe-hit

Learner needle
You half-heartedly consider violence, but you probably need thinking, instead.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-lo-low-lit

Learner needle
You wonder if the dark, or a racy novel, will help. Probably not.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-know-no-knit-nit

You can't see where to make a cut, and you have nothing to make a cut with.

#ttc-table-of-po-pit-guesses-snow-snit

#ttc-table-of-trim-tram-guesses-bind-bee

If there were a bee, it might distract you from being, well, you.

That might be cool, to make the puzzle a slam dunk and lose the last few pounds, but it's not sneaky enough. You must be close, though.

>bloke blessed

You feel a ripple as you throw unmerited kindness the joke jest poke pest's way. You yourself feel blessed, even though you may not be a bloke. Perhaps it doesn't make COMPLETE sense, but there's something to be said for being able to blow off annoyances with a bit of silliness. The pest does not even shine a why-white-lie light your way.

You have no fruit. However, the Ceiling Seer seems to appreciate your attempts to eat healthy.
