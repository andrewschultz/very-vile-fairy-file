#+ttc-table-of-narratives-1
A vision! Some tough-looking people sit sneering around an empty book. They are quickly revealed as the Plight Plotter, the Spite Spotter, the Fright Frotteur, and the Right Rotter. They are seeking to formalize the knowledge they have gained from picking on, well, fight fodder. Such as the Trite Trotter and the Night Nodder. You watch them each write parts of a book at ultra-speed before they walk out to by some white water and call out "Bright! Broader!"
The book's cover slowly becomes colored in. It is the Very Vile Fairy File.

#ttc-table-of-narratives-2
The plotters from your previous vision remark how it is not just a guide to manipulation, but something that can affect people from afar. Its one weakness: if someone gets too close and is legitimately happy and forgiving around it, its spell will break.
They leave it by the Real Rot/Feel Fought Spiel Spot, because they have other evil to delegate, elsewhere. Small relief--facing them would've been too much.

#ttc-table-of-narratives-3
Another vision!
A bunch of seedy looking hoodlums approach the shrine where the Very Vile Fairy File was left. You know they must be the Crimes Crew Times Two Kit Cohen told you about. While the general consensus is "What an unusually stupid looking book," they nonetheless play rock-paper-scissors to decide the poor sap who has to read it.

#ttc-table-of-narratives-4
The loser of the rock paper scissors game's eyes open wide as they realize the Very Vile Fairy File doesn't just have lame poetry. It has advice on important things like pushing people around and getting in their head! In the end, there's a fight over the book, but nobody manages to tear it apart. There's more fast-forwarding, and once everyone is done re-reading it, they leave it somewhere distant. Maybe for the next person, or their underlings, to read.
You can already feel the Very Vile Fairy File working on you, reminding you of things you'd rather forget. These brief flashes may pop up for the remainder of your adventure.

You feel a ripple as you throw unmerited kindness the joke jest poke pest's way. You yourself feel blessed, even though you may not be a b loke. Perhaps it doesn't make COMPLETE sense, but there's something to be said for being able to blow off annoyances with a bit of silliness. The pest does not even shine a why-white-lie light your way.

"So seedy! Grow greedy! No, needy!" taunts the joke jest poke pest. And it's sort of true. The more you've done, the more you want and need to see what's next, and you'd hate to give up. On the other hand, greedy people never admit they've gotten greedy... no, no, stop it! That can't be right!

"Hi, hi! Why, why? My, my! Sigh, sigh!" There was a time when you thought you didn't even deserve complex insults. But here--surely the Very Vile Fairy File is running out of steam? There's only one way to find out. Keep going!

"How hot NOW?! Not!" the joke jest poke pest insinuates. Yet, you sense desperation. It's relied more and more on telling you you aren't as great as you think, instead of that you're just awful. That's ... progress, huge progress.
