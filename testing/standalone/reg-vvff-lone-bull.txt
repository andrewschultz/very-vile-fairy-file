## NO GENERATOR FILE, JUST BULL CHASE TEST CASES

The bull is too fast and strong. It tears you up. Maybe there was some way to weaken it. At least it slinks back to where it was, maybe saving another beating for later.

# test doubling back

The Beer Bull catches you doubling back! What follows is ... not pretty.

# test general time wasting in Here Hull

The Beer Bull catches up to you! It charges and kicks you around for a while. Some part of it realizes if it does too much damage, it won't have a chance to kick you around again, so it retreats into its corner.

The Beer Bull thunders just behind. You need to keep moving, or it will catch you.

You limp back to Creased Cross.

The beer bull roars as you attempt the simple rhyme! Little surprise it hates any sort of poetry. While you're distracted, it slaps you around a bit.
Such a shame ... you should probably come back ASAP and do things without the bull chasing you.

Now you're not too distracted, CLEARED CLAY will probably work in Stark Store.

That might work on people who understand songs and poetry. The Beer Bull does not. You need a stronger way to kill it off.

Whoah! The Beer Bull seemed to run out of Tight Tunnel quickly. Perhaps you could lure it further. What could be to the west?

The Bull seems out of place here, but it's not particularly bothered by that.

Oh no! Between the Beer Bull and the fridge, you feel trapped, and you'd get caught boarding the boat

Oh no! The boring boat shuts itself up as the bull beast gets close. I guess the boat can't take the beast's exciting-ness. The beast seems offended enough to take it out a bit extra on you.

You lead the Beer Bull into Dives Ditch, where it pauses a bit before cornering you. Perhaps next time, with a bit more preparation, you could take the Beer Bull down.

Oh no! You don't have the time to place the snare AND distract the Bull Beast at once! Sorry about that. On the bright side, you managed to place the snare, though, and the Bull Beast was so busy beating you up, it didn't notice you setting a trap. So it's probably no problem just to come back here, now.

# winning without gold guard

You crawl through the Fight Funnel and roll off to the side. The Beer Bull, not knowing better, springs the snare! Aigh! In its death throes, the Beer Bull speaks its first--and last--words: "TRICK! TRAP! SICK SAP!" before it explodes, most of it tumbling into the remains of the Dives Ditch. But something's left behind: a flagon (or firkin or whatever) of mild mead, far less potent than whatever horrible alcohol the Beer Bull advertised.
/^You walk back to Here Hull, where a Gear Gull waits. "Thank you for freeing me from the Beer Bull. I would like to do you a favor in return." The Gear Gull inspects you.

"I see no armor I could help improve. Come back when you find it. But for now, I need time to reorganize my domain."

# winning with gold guard

>undo
>purloin gold guard
>w
The Gear Gull breaks out some polish. It doesn't just remove the mold but thickens the gold guard without making it heavier. You smile, but the Gear Gull says, "I can only make the gold guard so strong. There are materials that can do more. You must find them to be able to reach your goal. You are done here--no need to come back."

!You also feel more ready to face the beast boss, now.
