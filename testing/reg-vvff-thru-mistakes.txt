> stet stood
Learner needle
No comment on if and where proofreading is necessary, here.
> het hood
Learner needle
You consider the possibility of changing the Wet Wood to a Straight Pride parade, but decide against it, as you're worried you might get trampled by all of a dozen people.

> get good
by one point

> lift liver
Learner needle
You gain no nutritious meat nor uplifting advice. But you must be close. You just feel you could use another person's help, here.
> sift siever
Learner needle
That would be a good tool in a cooking simulation, but the Leet Learner is more useful. You just feel you could use another person's help, here.
> drift driver
Learner needle
No vehicle comes to take you across the river. And that doesn't quite rhyme, anyway. You just feel you could use another person's help, here.

Learner needle
You try fearing things different ways, but nobody comes to comfort you.

> hind halt
Learner needle
You do feel sort of paranoid here, but fortunately, nothing is behind you or needs to stop.
> signed salt
Learner needle
Alas, the walls of the vault do not turn to salt. Perhaps they still have a structural deficiency, though.
> wined walt
Learner needle
A drinking buddy you can play practical jokes on won't be any help here.

> wined walt
!Learner needle
A drinking buddy you can play practical jokes on won't be any help here.
> mind malt
!Learner needle
The mind malt is gone. You have to rely on yourself!

> bean bass
Learner needle
You could use a delicious meal, but perhaps there is something even simpler the mean mass can become.
> seen sass
Learner needle
You worry any sass you direct at the mean mass would be spun back at you. But there must be a way to change the mean mass!
> clean class
Learner needle
You can't help but feel the mean mass could be more wholesome, but that's not quite the right way to do things. It doesn't feel quite natural enough.
> glean glass
Learner needle
No, there's no hidden window you overlooked.
> lean lass
Learner needle
This isn't that sort of game.

> green grass
by one point

> cash cap
Learner needle
You need more than just a homonym here.
> clash clap
Learner needle
Your vehement applause goes unheeded. But perhaps other violence might be more productive.
> crash crap
Learner needle
Profanity isn't necessary, here. Even minor ones.
> gnash nap
Learner needle
You need something more active.
> sash sap
Learner needle
You don't need to be dressed outlandishly to figure what to do.
> flash flap
Learner needle
Perhaps more focused violence would work better.
> lash lap
Learner needle
You bang your fists against your pockets. It sort of helps, you guess.

> snow snit
Learner needle
No bad weather blows in to be complained about.
> crow crit
Learner needle
You wait for a little bird to give advice, but nothing happens.
> flow flit
Learner needle
You don't need your mind to wander further. You need to focus on a solution.
> foe fit
Learner needle
Complaining and speculation about who or what put you there won't help.
> go get
Learner needle
You have no-one to order around, not that it'd do any good.
> ho hit
Learner needle
You half-heartedly consider violence, but you probably need thinking, instead.
> lo lit
Learner needle
You wonder if the dark, or a racy novel, will help. Probably not.
> bo bit
Learner needle
There's no fiddly bit like a bow. You showed a bit of persistence there looking for it, though.
> slow slit
Learner needle
You can't see where to make a cut, and you have nothing to make a cut with.
> bro brit
Learner needle
You don't need a sidekick. Well, right now, you don't. Hard to summon them, anyway.
> know knit
Learner needle
You look for details to understand, but you might want to go in for a bigger picture.
> show shit
Learner needle
Profanity doesn't work here. But perhaps there is a similar phrase to help you feel tough enough!

Learner needle
Clever complaining will make you feel better but won't do anything.

> mash map

> bind be
Learner needle
Your incantation fails. Perhaps something more straightforward and inward-looking would work better.
> bind bee
Learner needle
If there were a bee, it might distract you from being, well, you.
> wined whee
Learner needle
Whether or not you are more or less tense, or more or less exciting, you need to focus on you the right way here.
> signed see
Learner needle
There's nobody to see any forged signature. Look within.
> tined tee
Learner needle
You don't have time for silly games like golf now!
> kind key
Learner needle
Oh, it won't be that easy. Someone won't drop a key for you. But you can do for yourself.

> mind me
by one point

> whim wham
Learner needle
Hmm, you try to figure a poetic way through, but perhaps you need something more worldly.
> grim gram
Learner needle
No elder appears to upbraid you, which is all for the better.
> jim jam
Learner needle
No pajamas appear. It's much too early for rest, anyway.
> dim dam
Learner needle
You need fewer blockages and/or minor curses, not more.
> swim swam
Learner needle
You don't need to fall in the water here.
> rim ram
Learner needle
Banging on the walls won't help.
> shim sham
Learner needle
Hmm. Interesting. But you might need to fake something besides a shim.
> him ham
Learner needle
Pigs, male or female, aren't allowed on public transport.
> prim pram
Learner needle
That worked in Trinity, but this game isn't Trinity. For better or, more likely, for worse.
> slim slam
Learner needle
That might be cool, to make the puzzle a slam dunk and lose the last few pounds, but it's not sneaky enough. You must be close, though.

> wheel weir
Learner needle
The Sage Sea is enough of a boundary.
> eel ear
!Learner needle
You don't need an eel, or a piece of one, to electrify things right now.
> peel pear
!Learner needle
You have no fruit. However, the Ceiling Seer seems to appreciate your attempts to eat healthy.
> steal steer
Learner needle
Direct homonyms don't work here, and the steer would not fit in your bag.
> wheel where
!Learner needle
The Ceiling Seer does not direct you to any wheel or any form of transportation.

> cage key
!Learner needle
You correctly guessed what's in the Sage Sea, but you need to be wise, not clever, to earn it.
> wage wee
!Learner needle
Hey, now! You're not in it for the money! Or a handheld game console!
> phage fee
!Learner needle
Biological warfare is too expensive.
> mage me
!Learner needle
One look at the Sage Sea and you remember mastering real magic takes training and practice. You'll find enough silly magic to do.

Learner needle
You don't need to skip around a book or summon anything.

This isn't a nature retreat.

!Learner needle
Your skin remains unblemished, despite you tempting fate.
> pun pen
!Learner needle
You find no way to reach behind the fourth wall and grab my pun pen. Besides, it's not the pen that's magically clever. It's me.
> won when
!Learner needle
Hey, now! The Fun Fen is too cheery for such "Am I done yet" angst.

Learner needle
You need something simpler than an unusual language here.

# must be after the FALL FREE or FRY FALL gives an erroneous HA HALF.

The wry wall relinquishes nothing. You're not sure what you'd do with a doll, anyway.
!Learner needle
>fry fall
!Learner needle
The wry wall remains upright.
>pry pall
!Learner needle
There is no hidden tomb under the wry wall.
>try tall
!Learner needle
The wry wall does not grow.

Learner needle
The leap wouldn't be live for very long.

Learner needle
You stare a bit but get no insight.

You'll need all the sauce you can get, literally or figuratively.

Learner needle
The creased cross doesn't need to become ickier.

Learner needle
Dental hygiene is a good idea in general, but here, it's unnecessary.

> woe whappin
Learner needle
You don't need an exhortation to violence.
> crow crappin
Learner needle
You plan out some filk called Bad Bird Had Heard, about Tad, but Toe Tappin' Row Rappin' is versatile enough. And this game isn't THAT juvenile. I hope.
> slow slappin
Learner needle
That would be handy in a more violent adventure, but not this one.
> flow flappin
Learner needle
That might be funky to some, but you need something more practical.
> low lappin
Learner needle
You put your best-ever time for a mile run to Toe Tappin' Row Rappin', but you can't see how it will help here. Plus, Chariots of Fire works better, anyway.
> butter bankster
Learner needle
The ganksta will never have such a good job. Perhaps you can make fun of something simpler the ganksta is proud of.
> frotz frame
Learner needle
Anything as esoteric as text adventure vocabulary would go over the Gutta Ganksta's head. You need to be more brutal.
> gene joes
Learner needle
You don't need to visit another clothing store.
> seen sos
Learner needle
That must be about right, but it's not specific enough. You need to see something specific, and not quite see...

That must be about right, but you need to do something to look and find a light, or lights.

Learner needle
No bows pop up to garnish your current clothes.

Learner needle
There are no dolls to manipulate in this game.
