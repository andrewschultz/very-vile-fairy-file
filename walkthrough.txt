This is a walkthrough for Very Vile Fairy File.

You can do something with the zigzag rig rag, but not right away. You don't want to be carrying it through the wet wood.

So let's leave the wet wood. It seems like there's no way out. But if you listen carefully and pay attention to clues, you can decide what to do.

> GET GOOD (1)

Oops! You fell into the Vined Vault, which seems to have no weaknesses.

> FIND FAULT (2)

But now you must deal with the Mean Mass.

> GREEN GRASS (3)

And now there is that trash trap. But that wrong art is messing with your mind. FIND FEE! And you have no money!

> MIND ME (4)

But, ugh! The trash trap is so odious. You don't have the guts. Something about this room...

> GROW GRIT (5)

You notice that at the start, it's -- well, laid out. What do you call those things that show what's where?

> MASH MAP (6)

One more thing! The trim tram needs you to pay to get it started.

There are three ways.

> FLIM FLAM (7)

The alternatives: no space, or you can also try a SKIM SCAM.

Well, that does it for the introduction.





















Now about that zig zag rig rag. It can become something more useful.

> BIG BAG (8)

Now at Cark Cliff, you have an opportunity for a bonus point, or you can just tell the Tall Tree what to do.

> FALL FREE (9)

> N

Jake G. presents a problem. But there are four ways to get rid of him. There's a one-letter solution, but there's also

> FAKE FEE (3)

> WAKE WHEE (4)

You can try the two others for bonus points if you want.

> E

> SHINING SHORE

The Lake Lap puzzle is also optional, but it is not too hard.

> SNAKE SNAP

> MAKE MAP

So now you have a handy map.

> W

> MYSTERY MALL (5)

You can twiddle back and forth as you need to.

> W

You can deal with the gutta ganksta if you want for an LLP, but he won't stop you.

> W

The marred mat isn't merchandise, but it could be.

> HARD HAT (6)

===========================BEGIN UNIMPLEMENTED MIDDLEGAME===========================



============================END UNIMPLEMENTED MIDDLEGAME============================

Here in the Last Lap, you sense you must be close. But how do you get anyone's attention?

Your hard hat is really more like a cap.

> CAST CAP (x-4)

You need to dispose of Reeker Russell and his good gun.

There's an LLP in here, but first, Russell can become wimpier ...

> MEEKER MUSCLE (x-3)

And the good gun can go lame.

> WOOD ONE (x-2)

Now you are free to go north.

>N

The airy isle still feels woeful. That well worn hell horn!

> TELL TORN (x-1)

Here in the Merry Mile, you've found the very vile fairy file! But what to do with it? You hate it too much to touch it.

This is something you may've seen right away, but it's the final thing you need to do.

> BURY BILE (x)

Congratulations. You win! I hope you enjoyed this.
