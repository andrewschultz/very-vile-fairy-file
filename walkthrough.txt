This is a walkthrough for Very Vile Fairy File.

You can do something with the zigzag rig rag, but not right away. You don't want to be carrying it through the wet wood. In fact, it may help give you clues if you look at it.

So let's leave the wet wood. It seems like there's no way out. But if you listen carefully and pay attention to clues, you can decide what to do.

> GET GOOD (1)

Oops! You found your way out but fell into the Vined Vault, which seems to have no weaknesses.

> FIND FAULT (2)

But now you must deal with the Mean Mass.

> GREEN GRASS (3)

Now, ugh! The trash trap is so odious. You don't have the guts. Something about this room...

> GROW GRIT (4)

You notice that at the start, it's -- well, laid out. What do you call those things that show what's where?

> MASH MAP (5)

Woohoo! You made it through, and now you need to fake your way into (not really) paying for a trip on the Trim Tram.

> MIND ME (6)

Okay, you're focused! Now the trim tram needs you to pay to get it started.

There are three ways.

> FLIM FLAM (7)

The alternatives: no space, or you can also try a SKIM SCAM.

Well, that does it for the introduction. You climb out of the Done Den to the Fun Fen. It gets a little less linear from here on out.





















Now about that zig zag rig rag. It can become something more useful.

> BIG BAG (8)

Now at Fun Fen, you have an opportunity for a bonus point in the long term, or you can just tell the Tall Tree what to do.

> FALL FREE (9)

> N

Jake G. presents a problem. But there are four ways to get rid of him. There's a one-letter solution, but there's also

> FAKE FEE (3)

> WAKE WHEE (4)

You can try the two others for bonus points if you want.

> E

> SHINING SHORE

The Lake Lap puzzle is also optional, but it is not too hard.

> SNAKE SNAP

> MAKE MAP

So now you have a handy map.

> W

> MYSTERY MALL

You can twiddle back and forth as you need to.

> W

You should LISTEN in Mystery Mall. The song is useful later.

>LISTEN

You can deal with the gutta ganksta if you want for an LLP, but he won't stop you.

> W

The marred mat isn't merchandise, but it could be.

> HARD HAT

In the Shirk Shell, you need to do something to get the Jerk Gel.

> WORK WELL

>E

Now you don't need to visit the Shirk Shell any more, so...

> LOFT LAND

This covers the shell and opens a new passage west.

> W

The screaming skull is annoying. You'll have to deal with it first.

> DREAMING DULL

How to get rid of the worst wave in the curst cave?

> FIRST FAVE

What can you get from the tool tap?

> COOL CAP

This will come in handy later.

============================END UNIMPLEMENTED MIDDLEGAME============================

Now in Creased Cross, you are ready to take on the Beast Boss.

> BEAST BOSS (x-7)

It will take something from you. But you don't know what!

> LEAST LOSS (x-6)

Now the Bull Beast is really out of place here. It's been defeated. Maybe it can be made into something ...

> FULL FEAST (x-5)

Woohoo! Everyone is happy! The Gassed Gap is now the Last Lap!

Now you sense you must be close. But how do you get anyone's attention?

Your cool cap is useful here.

> CAST CAP (x-4)

You need to dispose of Reeker Russell and his good gun.

There's an LLP in here, but first, Russell can become wimpier ...

> MEEKER MUSCLE (x-3)

And the good gun can go lame.

> WOOD ONE (x-2)

Now you are free to go north.

>N

The airy isle still feels woeful. That well worn hell horn!

> TELL TORN (x-1)

Here in the Airy Isle, you've found the very vile fairy file! But what to do with it? You hate it too much to touch it.

This is something you may've seen right away, but it's the final thing you need to do.

> BURY BILE (x)

Congratulations. You win! I hope you enjoyed this.
