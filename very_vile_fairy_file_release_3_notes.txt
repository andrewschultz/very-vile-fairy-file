Release 3 of Very Vile Fairy File provides:

--sped up parser error code
--homonym detection
--THINK now cues you better to what you already knew/did
--narratives follow when you achieve X points
--new fake death rooms
--more accurate cluing for variable length answers, e.g. with Jake G and with some songs

You have two warp commands I will not list in the game proper.

CLIMB CLEAR sends you to the Airy Isle and the endgame.
BLOW BY skips to the Fun Fen, if you're not already there.
TRICK TRIP or SLICK SLIP gets you through an initial puzzle.
