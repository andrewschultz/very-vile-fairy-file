Part 1. How it started.

Like Ailihphilia, I thought this would be a short game, or a part of a short game. I like making limericks in my spare time, and I must have stumbled on very/fairy and vile/file about the same time back in June 2018. The phrase 'very vile fairy file' amused me, but what could I do with it? I figured there couldn't be any rhymes where we changed the first sound...

...oh, wait, there were. So I figured the final command at first. You could BURY BILE. And you could do so in the Merry Mile, or perhaps the Airy Isle. The character's name fell out, too. You could be Kerry Kyle. I'm not good with creating female characters, but the least I can do is try and not make the character obviously male, so this seemed like a good step forward. I didn't know how much else there could be, so maybe it would just be a one-room EctoComp game.

With dual rhymes in my orbit, I slowly started peeling things off. Anything with an alliterative name, I went through the 44 English sounds to see if they could be fungible. (I didn't put a reference of sounds in an easy-to-reach spot early on. This cost me time. Eventually I put it at the top of my notes file.) Some things fell early, because they were straightforward, like GET GOOD in the wet wood. It seemed like an ideal start. Some were a bit trickier. Some went nowhere despite having promise. And my favorites were the ones that seemed unlikely, but I wanted to give them a chance. FIND FAULT was a big example of this. It worked so perfectly that you could do so in a Vined Vault, and that made up an early puzzle. Another flyer gave me the idea for Fall Fest as a place to maybe start your game. That turned up a whole ton of rhymes that led to the introduction!

So I had my notes file, and I had a list of double-rhymes. And, like so many games, I thought I had some good introductory puzzles, and the ending puzzle took shape quickly. So did the penultimate puzzle, with the Bot Board. Board, Lord and Horde just seemed to be itching for another rhyme if I could find it. The Bot Board fell out from the working title of my game, The Problems Compound ("The Directors of Bored.") I loved it but could never quite justify it, and the Bot Board feels like what they should've been. Summoning the Lot Lord and Hot Horde seemed perfect to take down the board. I actually didn't figure out the Sought Sword until a tester's good try very shortly before the deadline--I wrote in a Shot Sword with a month left, mentioning it looked slightly out of place, as a Sot Sword seemed a bit silly. I took forever to see the homonym.

I've had a lot of games work like this, with the start and end just so, and I needed to fill out the middle.

Also, I don't think I mentioned that testers actively helped me create new puzzles or better solutions in this game, and while they're always very good for saying when I need clues, they showed me good alternate verbs--or in some cases, gave me verbs that overwrote the main ones. WINDING WAYS replacing MINDING MAZE was an example.

Part 2. Mashing ideas together, plus hint items and options

The middlegame was tricky, though! Last Lap was pretty clear, and I had a Hard Hat, but I wanted something more. I had some vague ideas for Creased Cross and the Beast Boss you needed to fight there. I wanted to have a distant land with lakes, because "lake" rhymed so well, but couldn't figure anything with a boat. And I was still worried the hinting device just wasn't good enough. I sent the game off to a few people with a caveat that the middlegame was unfinished. Their efforts helped--I needed to work on the intro and the ending and the hinting. Also, the volume of good guesses quickly gave me confidence that people would have fun guessing wrong, and I wanted to reward them.

I felt guilty sending out something incomplete to my testers, but I did have a jump command to the end, and it turned out sending a partial game off was the right thing to do. I should've done it sooner. Once I got some data from my testers, especially about difficulties in the introduction, I was much more motivated to find and create a hint item.

My early testers' efforts spurred me to create the Lurking Lump as a hint item. It was in the back of my mind, and it was one of those "I'd do it if I found inspiration" things. Then one morning I wondered if I could do something with jump. Maybe the player could have a lump. What sort of jump and lump? Oh--jerking and lurking. I'd had a similar item for Ailihphilia, the eye and the pip in the pact cap lighting up. I hope it never gets old, saying "Oh, I'd like to make a hint item but it might be too on-the-nose, or I might not have anything at all," and being able to chip away to make it reasonably believable and yet not too obvious. I feel fortunate. But the first draft--well, it was not so hot.

The Leet Learner was originally color-based: yellow meant that the answer had the same number of letters in each word. Blue meant you added to the letters in each word, and green meant only one. Red and orange meant take away letters from each, or just from one. This was awkward, and my testers, who came up with lots of wonderful original guesses didn't figure it out, but I'm glad I had the foresight to define cheat-states as leteq, bothplus, oneplus, oneminus, and bothminus. Because when I realized it'd probably be better to have a needle swinging (partially) left or right, I only had to change one line of code. This was handy, two weeks before deadline. I had to clean up any text saying yellow/orange/green/red/blue, but I'd kept all that text in one line.

The other big problem with hinting was this: a tester would guess one word right, but not another. I wanted to give them credit for this. I also ran into a problem where I exceeded the number of verbs the Z-machine could handle, both with valid verbs and good guesses. These two problems were related. I had to abuse the parser to fix this.

Inform's usual syntax might be: understand "find fault" as findfaulting / carry out findfaulting, etc. This created too many verbs, and it didn't help me track half-right guesses. So instead I moved the code a parser-error function, and it was nice to have everything in one place.

table of verb checks [xxvc]
w1 (text)	w2 (text)	okflip	core	idid	ver-rule	do-rule	wfull (topic)
...
"find"	"fault"	true	true	false	vc-find-fault rule	vr-find-fault rule	--

this is the vc-find-fault rule:
	if player is not in Vined Vault, the rule fails;
	if mean mass is in Vined Vault:
		if print-why-fail, vcal "You already did, and things got worse. You'll have to try something else.";
		continue the action;
	the rule succeeds;

this is the vr-find-fault rule:
	loop-note "FIND FAULT";
	say "It sure seems, at first glance, like the Vined Vault is inescapable. But you notice a few flaws. A loose tile, a crack in the wall ... you have all sorts of time, and there are no guards. And here you go ... if you do THIS, and THIS ...[wfak]";
	say "[line break]But of course something outside rushes into the fault you found in the vault. A mean mass roars in and mangles the packet of Mind Malt! It pulses threateningly, and while it hasn't attacked you, it now blocks your way out!";
	move mean mass to Vined Vault;
	moot mind malt;
	phbt Vined Vault;

Some of the text may seem odd ("moot" means move to the done room) but the basic idea is that the vc (verb check) rules make sure an action is valud, and a vr (verb result) rule executes that action. (If you're curious, OKFLIP means Fault Find is okay, CORE means the action must be done, and IDID checks if it's been done--so, for instance, you couldn't get infinite points for alternately typing SOFT SAND and LOFT LAND. wfull is useful for if there is more than one possible solution.) VCAL/VCP are for if you use the Lurking Lump. It checks through all the rules, so a simple "say" would print stuff that doesn't make sense.

And if the command only matches one of w1 and w2, then the Leet Learner tracks that and prints out an "ooh! Close!" if half-detection is on, which it should be, by default. (I was proud of the toggle command, though. I always wanted to use "NAFF" in a game.)

There were a lot more bugs in this mechanism than I thought, but they were worth working out. And it also played into one other thing: easier credit for good guesses. Since "understand X as a mistake" counted against verbs, I wondered if putting things in a table was worth it. It turns out they were, because I was able to simplify the leet learner cluing mechanism.

table of mistake substitutions
mist-cmd(topic)	mist-rule	got-yet	w1let	w2let	leet-rule	mist-txt
...
"binding bays/baize"	in-blaze-ways rule	false	7	4	blaze-before-maze rule	"You need to break free here, not get more tied up." [start blinding blaze]

There's a lot to unpack in this row, but it describes all I needed to check. The mist-rule simply checks if you are in Blinding Blaze (later called Winding Ways and Grinding Grays.) If not, the mistake is not registered. The got-yet entry merely makes sure you don't double-dip to charge the lurking lump. This means "binding bays" and "binding baize" aren't different enough to give two guesses, but on the other hand, I give a lot of credit for homonyms.

w1let and w2let track the letters you want and need. In this case, you need 7 and 4 to say Winding Ways or Minding Maze. (Finding Phase also works, but it has a different number of letters. It'd be confusing for the player to take this obscure--but sensible and creative--guess into account. I think allowing for alternate solutions is good, but having the Leet Learner account for all of them would be too awkward.) So the game knows that binding bays would give a center reading (7/4 vs 7/4) but binding baize would give a center-right reading (7/5 vs 7/4). The blaze-before-maze rule is the final bit. If you've already gotten rid of the blaze, a clue from the Leet Learner would be misleading. So that is the check for a clue after displaying the mist-txt.

This made it easy to add good guesses my testers turned up, which is one thing I worried about at the start. But it required a lot of programming on my own. Still, it was a rewarding bit of coding. I'd never really subverted the parser before, and 1. I think I had a good reason to and 2. subverting the parser made me realize how robust it was and how well it served for, well, games that didn't abuse the parser like VVFF did.

One other problem with hints is that I didn't hint when to use Toe Tappin' Row Rappin' until almost too late. This had testers finding the song puzzles obscure. But fortunately I had enough of a burst of insight to allow the player to toggle the song with SAVE SONG and RAVE WRONG.

Part 3 -- stumbling on stuff

You need to expect a lot of fishing expeditions will turn up empty, and a lot that seem silly will wind up okay. There were dry spells from about May to July. I didn't do much more than add in a death rooms or write up and inspect daily notes. But it was enough. Still, when something dropped, it DROPPED.

The angst puzzles on Been Buggin (so sad / way wrong) were originally dropped in after you scored 20 or 30 points, which was random, and if the bull was chasing you ... uh oh! And not just for you, but for me, the coder.

But I wanted them in there. I didn't know what to do! But one Friday night I was out. I'd been out sooner if I hadn't misplaced my keys. I cleaned up a lot, and finally I got where I wanted to be three hours late. One person at the party was wearing a "MEAN MUGGIN" t-shirt, and so a quick flip through sounds in my head gave me BEEN BUGGIN and LEAN LUGGIN. But no, that was just a bit silly without... whoah! So sad and Way wrong were a form of buggin'! This could work! But I'd think Been Buggin would have to be a quiet retreat. A retreat with a boat, maybe. This prompted all kinds of changes. I eventually pulled Lake Lap from the main area to the island to the side, and I figured the boat could go two places. But it was just the oddest place to get an idea, and even though I got to the party late, just getting MEAN MUGGIN would've been worth it.

Dean Duggan actually didn't come by until later. I forget what you were doing there beforehand.

The Real Rear was another one that seemed too plain once I saw it. Sometimes you look so much for a tough idea that you ignore easy intuitive ones. But I think it started from when I had the Beer Bull and DEAR DULL/NEAR NULL as a point-scoring command and at first I worried things would be too similar--but Real Rear just had so many rhymes. So things grew in leaps and bounds, but being impatient for the next leap never worked.

Part 4 -- fleshing out details

I had fun imagining the responses to BURY BILE as the game went through. At first, you couldn't just say it, you had to live it and be a worthy hero. I wanted to play this angle more, and for humor. I'm not sure if it worked, but I was thrilled I was able to allow the player to guess the winning command before scoring a single point. I'd played a lot of games where you could get a good ending, then replay and do something at the start to unlock something else perhaps even better, but I am not aware of any game that let you guess what to do right away.

And I suppose there's some emotional component to all this. If you've ever heard "Ahh, deal with it," over something you were upset about--well, not being able to BURY BILE effectively until you've fought through that kind of flips that advice on its head. So I was pleased with that.

Still, the beginning did not quite line up with the ending. Slowly I started finding things to do. Somehow, Lake Lap was east of the Whining War, and so I pushed the war further east and the two lakes to an island. The hall/mall was just west of the Cross, until I thought "What if I throw in one more store in back?" and realized it would work great in front. Then I realized it could open an area that made the bull chase most melodramatic.

Other stuff joggled around until the final day. I was curious why my observant testers hadn't found more bonus points, and then with a manual playthrough, I realized that's because those bonus points were mostly or completely unobservable. I'm glad I didn't put too much time into them, but on the other hand, I wish I'd had a "play-dumb-through" before then. Maybe I should do it more--I fixed up a lot of narrative stuff I had meant to.

But I'd left holes it wasn't really possible for my testers to plug. There were holes behind holes. Some puzzles that were horribly clued at first, so my testers had to use the walkthrough, which meant they couldn't use their energies for more interesting bugs. This happened with COUPLE CAPS, which was badly clued at first, so nobody tried it after getting all three caps. I clued it much better in response to testers having trouble, and the result was--COUPLE CAPS right after getting all three caps turned up a bug where you were sent back to Lake Lap instead of Been Buggin'. Since my main sanity-check walkthrough didn't COUPLE CAPS until the very end, well...ouch!

So this is a cautionary tale about how bad hinting doesn't just annoy the judges, and even if you fix the bad hinting late on, there's still an increased chance of bugs popping up, because you never gave your testers a chance to find things. I know I did a lot of automated testing which helped a lot, and I think that left my testers freedome to be creative. I suppose I thought I could skate a bit with walking through my own game, since I was able to run scripts. I don't know what I did with the time I saved. Probably wasted it somewhere less productive where I came up with fewer ideas. That's a big pitfall of testing. If something turns up, oh no, I messed up, but if it doesn't, I feel like I wasted time instead of saying--yeah, that's OK, I don't need my testers to check that. It doesn't feel like as much of an accomplishment as winning some click-around game I won before, but it is a far better use of time.

I know I certainly didn't run some simple tests I could've because they seemed boring and probably would not turn anything up. I keep forgetting that if they pass, it's one less dumb bug that slips through, and it's easy to test later. If they fail, that's one less annoying thing for testers.

So I spent a lot of time in-comp creating the test scripts I could and should have created earlier. It was rewarding.

Part 5 -- branching changes in-comp

I quickly got useful feedback in-comp for things to do. I didn't really look at all possible rhymes, because that was low-priority, so I wound up with fifty to add to my table of good guesses. That went into the post-comp changes, along with changing the vapor vile to a vapor vial. I'd written that about noon of the deadline date, and I just forgot it with other stuff to do, which was more important anyway. I realized making the player wait to get the big bag was silly--I wanted to avoid something that wasn't worth avoiding. I added a few death rooms. I forgot the post-game option to show all random text.

That was all creative, so it couldn't really go inton the comp. But I discovered a bug where guesses made the leet learner light up. Someone else found a bug where you could have -1 good guesses til your next lump charge. Someone else noticed the Gear Gull wasn't visible in Here Hull--it took me two tries to understand I'd let the player go to Here Hull when I thought I'd blocked them. I realized I wasn't rejecting homonyms as specifically ("Hey! You're super-close!") as I thought I was. I realized the GO TO command had obscure bugs.
